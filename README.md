This model applies tags from the archival corpus to new meeting notes
The dataset SNET_dataset.csv was used to train the model
The data set sontains two columns, meeting notes and the tags
We trained the model to understand the relationship between meeting notes and tags
We trained it using BERT 
To get more relevant tags on each meeting note we will give as input, we integrated a similarity index
This ensures that the applied tags from the corpus are related to the new meeting note being inputed
