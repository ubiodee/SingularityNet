"R&D Guild Regular Guild operations, governance system, project proposals People present- Rojo \[facilitator], Guillermo \[documenter], Ubio, Curtis, Vasu, Duke, WaKa  The overall purpose of the meeting was to go over the new R\&D Guild proposal, the new workgroup operations strategy, and fundamentals for the governance system for the guild Discussed the difference and definition of Resaerch, Ideation and Development, and the potential scope of the Guild in relation to ambassadors' needs, and how to approach the different guilds and WorkGroups for further actions.
* We continued with the discussion that began in the guild Discord chat about the possible segregation or not into two independent bodies, advantages and disadvantages. The members will present their positions and arguments.
* WaKa: I envision \*\*Innovation\*\* \[ex-Incubation] providing a range of services to other Ambassador units, according to their needs and our capabilities. These will eventually include analysis of wants and needs, identifying processes, features and benefits, crafting designs and executing development, organizing testing, deployment, training, and support. Ambassador program has a very specific charter and a fixed budget, in most ways separate organization from a dozen and a half projects and organizations under the sNET umbrella. To me, a Guild formed within Ambassadors and applying its budget has an obligation to focus on executing a definitive segment of the overall organizational vision and plan. Providing services according to the needs and the timelines of other groups, while tapping into their budgets, is best delivered by a separate unit, perhaps a financially self-sufficient WorkGroup. Without a clear separation, I do not see bringing more external business or recruiting specific skill sets, as those may not align with Ambassadors' mandate and plan.""
* Rojo: The R\&D initiative is funded based on projects according to the sheet we agreed upon. That means that the ambassador program is funding specific projects with clear outcomes and use cases. Any external endowment, if agreed upon, will also be funding a specific project. Therefore, double rewarding for the same work, or making use of ambassador funds for other entities, cannot happen under this paradigm.""
* Discussed the different governance systems. For the selection of the proposals to be developed according to the available budget, the possibility of involving the different guilds in the selection was discussed, thus establishing a priority according to the needs of the group.&#x20;
* Discussed the possibility of voting among guild members.","Teamwork, deliverables, respect, scope, flow, tooling, results, trust"
